# Backoffice

Framework based on [Material UI](https://material-ui-next.com), a Material UI
React implementation that provided a couple of components you might want to use
in a backoffice app.

Backoffice also uses `react-router-dom`, `,material-ui-icons` and some more OSS.

## Components

* Home: Dashboard-like homepage
* Menu: A menu that lists entries
* Listing: Data-Table
* AddButton: Button in the bottom right, that let's you link to a new page
* NoMatch: A content-snippet for 404 pages
* Drawer: Element that has an (off-canvas) menu
